### Overview of design need
- Is there an existing GitHub issue this design work pertains to? 
- If so, provide a link to it
- Also link to any specific comments or threads where the problem to be solved by design is mentioned
- In a sentence or two, describe the problem to be solved for users

### What level of design is needed? (Choose all that apply)
_This section may be updated by the designer / UX researcher working on this issue_

- [ ] **User experience research:**  high-level recommendation/exploration of user needs, design heuristics, and / or best practices to inform a design experience  
(Use this option when you feel there’s a challenge to be solved, but you’re curious about what the experience should be — may involve research studies to understand challenges/opportunities for design)
- [ ] **information flow / conceptual:** organizing and structuring of information flow and content, including layout on screen or across multiple steps
- [ ] **Visual:** creating mockups, icons, etc
(If choosing this level alone, it means that the content to be mocked up and its organization is already known and specified)

### Is design a blocker?
- [ ] **Yes:** engineering cannot proceed without a design first
- [ ] **No:** engineering can create a first version, and design can come in later to iterate and refine

If selecting **Yes**, how much design input is needed to unblock engineering? For example, is a full, final visual design needed, or just a recommendation of which conceptual direction to go?
