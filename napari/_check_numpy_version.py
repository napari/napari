"""
This module is used to prevent a known issue with numpy<2 on macOS arm64
architecture installed from pypi wheels
(https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/21799).

We use a method to set thread limits based on the threadpoolctl package, but
reimplemented locally to prevent adding the dependency to napari.

Note: if any issues surface with the method below, we could fall back on
depending on threadpoolctl directly.

TODO: This module can be removed once the minimum numpy version is 2+.

    On NumPy version<2 wheels on macOS ARM64 architectures, a BusError is
    raised, crashing Python, if NumPy is accessed from multiple threads.
    (See https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/21799.) This function uses the
    global check above (NUMPY_VERSION_IS_THREADSAFE), and, if False, it loads
    the linked OpenBLAS library and sets the number of threads to 1. This has
    performance implications but prevents nasty crashes, and anyway can be
    avoided by using more recent versions of NumPy.

    This function is loading openblas library from numpy and set number of threads to 1.
