class PerfEvent:
    """A performance related event: timer, counter, etc.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str
        The name of this event like "draw".
    start_ns : int
        Start time in nanoseconds.
    end_ns : int
        End time in nanoseconds.
    category :str
        Comma separated categories such has "render,update".
    process_id : int
        The process id that produced the event.
    thread_id : int
        The thread id that produced the event.
    phase : str
        The Chrome Tracing "phase" such as "X", "I", "C".
    **kwargs : dict
        Additional keyword arguments for the "args" field of the event.


    Attributes
    ----------
    name : str
        The name of this event like "draw".
    span : Span
        The time span when the event happened.
    category : str
        Comma separated categories such has "render,update".
    origin : Origin
        The process and thread that produced the event.
    args : dict
        Arbitrary keyword arguments for this event.
    phase : str
        The Chrome Tracing phase (event type):
          "X" - Complete Events
          "I" - Instant Events
          "C" - Counter Events
    Notes
    -----
    The time stamps are from perf_counter_ns() and do not indicate time of
    day. The origin is arbitrary, but subtracting two counters results in a
    valid span of wall clock time. If start is the same as the end the
    event was instant.

    Google the phrase "Trace Event Format" for the full Chrome Tracing spec.
