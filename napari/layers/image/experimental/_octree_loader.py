class OctreeLoader:
    """Load data into the OctreeChunks in the octree.

    The loader is given drawn_set, the chunks we are currently drawing, and
    ideal_chunks, the chunks which are in view at the desired level of the
    octree.

    The ideal level was chosen because its image pixels best match the
    screen pixels. Using higher resolution than that is okay, but it's
    wasted time and memory. Using lower resolution is better than nothing,
    but it's going to be blurrier than the ideal level.

    Our get_drawable_chunks() method iterates through the ideal_chunks
    choosing what chunks to load, in what order, and producing the set of
    chunks the visual should draw.

    Choosing what chunks to load and draw is the heart of octree rendering.
    We use the tree structure to find child or parent chunks, or chunks
    futher up the tree: ancestor chunks.

    The goal is to pretty quickly load all the ideal chunks, since that's
    what we really want to draw. But in the meantime we load and display
    chunks at lower or high resolutions. In some cases because they already
    loaded and even already being drawn. In other cases though we load
    chunk from high level because they provide "coverage" quickly.

    As you go up to higher levels from the ideal level, the chunks on those
    levels cover more and more chunks on the ideal level. As you go up
    levels they cover this number of ideal chunks: 4, 16, 64.

    The data from higher levels is blurry compared to the ideal level, but
    getting something "reasonable" on the screen quickly often leads to the
    best user experience. For example, even "blurry" data is often good
    enough for them to keep navigating, to keep panning and zooming looking
    for whatever they are looking for.

        """Return the chunks that should be drawn.

        The ideal chunks are within the bounds of the OctreeView, but they
        may or may not be in memory. We only return chunks which are in
        memory.

        Generally we want to draw the "best available" data. However, that
        data might not be at the ideal level.

        So we look in two directions:
        1) Up, to find a chunk at a higher (coarser) level.
        2) Down, to look for a drawable chunk at a lower (finer) level.

        The TiledImageVisual can draw overlapping tiles/chunks. For example
        suppose below B and C are ideal chunks, but B is drawable while C
        is not. We search up from C and find A.

        ----------
        |    A   |
        | --- ---|
        |  B | C |
        |---------

        TiledImageVisual will render A first, because it's at a higher
        level, and then B. So the visual will render B and A with B on top.
        The region defined by C is showing A, until C is ready to draw.

        The first thing we do is find the best single chunk in memory that will
        cover all the ideal chunks, and draw that. Drawing this chunk will happen
        right away and ensure that something is always drawn and the canvas never
        flickers to empty. Worst case we draw the root tile.

        Next we look through all the ideal chunks and see what are the already drawn
        chunks that we should just leave there. If the ideal chunk has been drawn then
        it does not need any additional coverage and we move on. We next look to see if
        all four children are already drawn, this happens most often when zooming out,
        and if so we leave them there. If the ideal chunk is in memory we'll draw it too.
        If not, we then look to see what the closet in memory ancestor and closet drawn ancestors
        are. If they are the same then we'll draw that chunk, along with the ideal chunk if
        it is in memory too. If they are not the same then we'll draw the closest drawn ancestor
        and either the closest in memory chunk or the ideal chunk if
        it is in memory too.

        Finally, we will start loading any ideal chunks that aren't in memory that we want to
        draw.

        Parameters
        ----------
        drawn_chunk_set : Set[OctreeChunk]
