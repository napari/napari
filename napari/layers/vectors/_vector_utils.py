    Parameters
    ----------
    vectors : (N, 2, D) or (N1, N2, ..., ND, D) array
        A (N, 2, D) array is interpreted as "coordinate-like" data and a list

        "image-like" data where there is a length D vector of the
        projections at each pixel.

    Returns
    -------
    coords : (N, 2, D) array
        A list of N vectors with start point and projections of the vector
        in D dimensions.
