        array if each shape has the same number of vertices.
    ndim : int
        Number of dimensions for shapes. When data is not None, ndim must be D.
        An empty shapes layer can be instantiated with arbitrary ndim.

        possible values for each property.
    text : str, dict
        Text to be displayed with the shapes. If text is set to a key in properties,

        composed using f-string-like syntax (e.g., '{property_1}, {float_property:.2f}).
        A dictionary can be provided with keyword arguments to set the text values
        and display properties. See TextManager.__init__() for the valid keyword arguments.

        (property.min(), property.max())
    face_color : str, array-like
        If string can be any color name recognized by vispy or hex value if
        starting with `#`. If array-like must be 1-dimensional array with 3

        Colormap to set face_color if a continuous attribute is used to set face_color.
    face_contrast_limits : None, (float, float)
        clims for mapping the property to a color map. These are the min and max value
        of the specified property that are mapped to 0 and 1, respectively.

        the final column is a length N translation vector and a 1 or a napari
        `Affine` transform object. Applied as an extra transform on top of the
        provided scale, rotate, and shear values.
    opacity : float

    blending : str
        One of a list of preset blending modes that determines how RGB and

    feature_defaults : DataFrame-like
        Stores the default value of each feature in a table with one row.
    properties : dict {str: array (N,)}, DataFrame
        Properties for each shape. Each property should be an array of length N,

    text : str, dict
        Text to be displayed with the shapes. If text is set to a key in properties,
        the value of that property will be displayed. Multiple properties can be
        composed using f-string-like syntax (e.g., '{property_1}, {float_property:.2f}).

        resized.

        The DIRECT mode allows for shapes to be selected and their individual
        vertices to be moved.

        The VERTEX_INSERT and VERTEX_REMOVE modes allow for individual
        vertices either to be added to or removed from shapes that are already
        selected. Note that shapes cannot be selected in this mode.

        The ADD_RECTANGLE, ADD_ELLIPSE, ADD_LINE, ADD_PATH, and ADD_POLYGON
        modes all allow for their corresponding shape type to be added.

    _selected_box : None | np.ndarray
        `None` if no shapes are selected, otherwise a 10x2 array of vertices of

        If a drag box is being created to select shapes then this is a 2x2
        array of the two extreme corners of the drag. `None` otherwise.
    _drag_box_stored : None | np.ndarray
        If a drag box is being created to select shapes then this is a 2x2

        when shapes are selected and the properties are changed based on that
        selection

    _colors : list
        List of supported vispy color names.
