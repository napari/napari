    The 2D bounding box extends infinitely in both directions along its normal
    vector.

    Point selection algorithm:
        1. Project the points in view and drag box corners on to a plane
        parallel to the canvas (i.e., normal direction is the view direction).
        2. Rotate the points/bbox corners to a new basis comprising
        the bbox normal, the camera up direction, and the
        "horizontal direction" (i.e., vector orthogonal to bbox normal
        and camera up direction). This makes it such that the bounding box
        is axis aligned (i.e., the major and minor axes of the bounding
        box are aligned with the new 0 and 1 axes).
        3. Determine which points are in the bounding box in 2D. We can
        simplify to 2D since the points and bounding box now lie in the same
        plane.

    Parameters
    ----------

        The (2 x 3) array containing the two 3D points that are opposing corners
