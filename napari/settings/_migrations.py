    In #5103 we went from using our own keybinding model to using app-model's.
    Several consequences of this are:
    - Control is written out as Ctrl (and that is the only valid input)
    - Option is written out as Alt (and that is the only valid input)
    - Super/Command/Cmd are written out as Meta (both Meta and Cmd are valid
      inputs)
    - modifiers with keys are written as Mod+Key rather than Mod-Key. However,
      both versions are valid inputs.
    - macOS shortcuts using command keys are written out as Meta, where they
      used to be written out as Control.

    The alias problem is solved in `napari.utils.keybindings.coerce_keybinding`
    by substituting all variants with the canonical versions in app-model.

    The separator problem (-/+) can be ignored.

    This migrator solves the final problem, by detecting whether the current
    OS is macOS, and swapping Control and Meta in all key bindings if so.
