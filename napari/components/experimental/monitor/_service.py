"""MonitorService class.

Experimental shared memory service.

Requires Python 3.9, for now at least.

Monitor Config File
-------------------
Only if NAPARI_MON is set and points to a config file will the monitor even
start. The format of the .napari-mon config file is:

{
    "clients": [
        ["python", "/tmp/myclient.py"]
    ]
    "log_path": "/tmp/monitor.log"
}

All of the listed clients will be started. They can be the same program run
with different arguments, or different programs. All clients will have
access to the same shared memory.

Client Config File
-------------------
The client should decode the contents of the NAPARI_MON_CLIENT variable. It
can be decoded like this:

    def _get_client_config() -> dict:
        env_str = os.getenv("NAPARI_MON_CLIENT")
        if env_str is None:
            return None

        env_bytes = env_str.encode('ascii')
        config_bytes = base64.b64decode(env_bytes)
        config_str = config_bytes.decode('ascii')

        return json.loads(config_str)

Today the client configuration is only:

    {
        "server_port": "<number>"
    }

Client Startup
--------------

See a working client: https://github.com/pwinston/webmon

The client can access the MonitorApi by creating a SharedMemoryManager:

    napari_api = ['shutdown_event', 'command_queue', 'data']
    for name in napari_api:
        SharedMemoryManager.register(name)

    SharedMemoryManager.register('command_queue')
    self.manager = SharedMemoryManager(
        address=('localhost', config['server_port']),
        authkey=str.encode('napari')
    )

    # Get the shared resources.
    shutdown = self._manager.shutdown_event()
    commands = self._manager.command_queue()
    data = self._manager.data()

It can send command like:

    commands.put(
       {"test_command": {"value": 42, "names": ["fred", "joe"]}}
    )

Passing Data From Napari To The Client
--------------------------------------
In napari add data like:

    if monitor:
        monitor.add({
            "tiled_image_layer": {
                "num_created": stats.created,
                "num_deleted": stats.deleted,
                "duration_ms": elapsed.duration_ms,
            }
        })

The client can access data['tiled_image_layer']. Clients should be
resilient to missing data. Nn case the napari version is different than
expected, or is just not producing that data for some reason.

Future Work
-----------
We plan to investigate the use of numpy shared memory buffers for bulk
binary data. Possibly using recarray to organized things.

    Originally we used a ShareableList and serialized JSON into one of the

    but it's nicer that doing int ourselves.

    So this class is not doing much right now. However if we add true

    those.
