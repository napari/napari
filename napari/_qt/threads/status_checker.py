    """Separate thread dedicated to updating the status bar.

    Prior to https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/7146, status bar updates
    happened on the main thread in the viewer model, which could be
    expensive in some layers and resulted in bad performance when some
    layers were selected.

    This class puts the job of computing the status into a separate thread,
    which then uses Qt Signals to update the main viewer with the status
    string.

    Because the thread runs a single infinite while loop, the updates are
    naturally throttled to as fast as they can be computed, but no faster.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _need_status_update : threading.Event
        An Event (fancy thread-safe bool-like to synchronize threads)
        for keeping track of when the status needs updating
        (because the cursor has moved).
    _terminate : bool
        Whether the thread needs to be terminated. Set by the QtViewer
        when it is being closed. No more status updates will take place if
        _terminate is set.
    viewer_ref : weakref.ref[napari.viewer.ViewerModel]
        A weak reference to the viewer providing the status updates. We
        don't want this thread to prevent the viewer from being garbage
        collected, so we keep only a weak reference, and check it when
        we need to compute a new status update.
