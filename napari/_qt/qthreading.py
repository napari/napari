    Attempts to clean up all running workers by calling ``worker.quit()``

    By default, this function will block indefinitely, until worker threads
    finish.  If a timeout is provided, a ``RuntimeError`` will be raised if
    the workers do not gracefully exit in the time requests, but the threads

        If the user does not put any yields in their function, and the function

    """Decorator that runs a function in a separate thread when called.

    When called, the decorated function returns a :class:`WorkerBase`.  See
    :func:`create_worker` for additional keyword arguments that can be used
    when calling the function.

    The returned worker will have these signals:

        - *started*: emitted when the work is started
        - *finished*: emitted when the work is finished
        - *returned*: emitted with return value
        - *errored*: emitted with error object on Exception

    It will also have a ``worker.start()`` method that can be used to start
    execution of the function in another thread. (useful if you need to connect
    callbacks to signals prior to execution)

    If the decorated function is a generator, the returned worker will also
    provide these signals:

        - *yielded*: emitted with yielded values
        - *paused*: emitted when a running job has successfully paused
        - *resumed*: emitted when a paused job has successfully resumed
        - *aborted*: emitted when a running job is successfully aborted

    And these methods:

        - *quit*: ask the thread to quit
        - *toggle_paused*: toggle the running state of the thread.
        - *send*: send a value into the generator.  (This requires that your
          decorator function uses the ``value = yield`` syntax)

    Parameters
    ----------
    function : callable
        Function to call in another thread.  For communication between threads
        may be a generator function.
    start_thread : bool, optional
        Whether to immediaetly start the thread.  If False, the returned worker
        must be manually started with ``worker.start()``. by default it will be
        ``False`` if the ``_connect`` argument is ``None``, otherwise ``True``.
    connect : Dict[str, Union[Callable, Sequence]], optional
        A mapping of ``"signal_name"`` -> ``callable`` or list of ``callable``:
        callback functions to connect to the various signals offered by the
        worker class. by default None
    worker_class : Type[WorkerBase], optional
        The :class`WorkerBase` to instantiate, by default
        :class:`FunctionWorker` will be used if ``func`` is a regular function,
        and :class:`GeneratorWorker` will be used if it is a generator.
    ignore_errors : bool, optional
        If ``False`` (the default), errors raised in the other thread will be
        reraised in the main thread (makes debugging significantly easier).

    Returns
    -------
    callable
        function that creates a worker, puts it in a new thread and returns
        the worker instance.

# This is a variant on the above pattern, it uses QThread instead of Qrunnable
# see https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/threads-technologies.html#comparison-of-solutions
# (it appears from that table that QRunnable cannot emit or receive signals,
# but we circumvent that here with our WorkerBase class that also inherits from
# QObject... providing signals/slots).
#
# A benefit of the QRunnable pattern is that Qt manages the threads for you,
# in the QThreadPool.globalInstance() ... making it easier to reuse threads,
# and reduce overhead.
#
# However, a disadvantage is that you have no access to (and therefore less
# control over) the QThread itself.  See for example all of the methods
# provided on the QThread object: https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qthread.html


# TODO: potentially remove this altogether, by refactoring the dims
# AnimationWorker to subclass WorkerBase


def _new_worker_qthread(

):
    """This is a convenience function to start a worker in a Qthread.

    In most cases, the @thread_worker decorator is sufficient and preferable.
    But this allows the user to completely customize the Worker object.
    However, they must then maintain control over the thread and clean up
    appropriately.

    It follows the pattern described here:
    https://www.qt.io/blog/2010/06/17/youre-doing-it-wrong
    and
    https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qthread.html#details

    see also:
    https://mayaposch.wordpress.com/2011/11/01/how-to-really-truly-use-qthreads-the-full-explanation/

    A QThread object is not a thread! It should be thought of as a class to
    *manage* a thread, not as the actual code or object that runs in that
    thread.  The QThread object is created on the main thread and lives there.

    Worker objects which derive from QObject are the things that actually do
    the work. They can be moved to a QThread as is done here.

    .. note:: Mostly ignorable detail

        While the signals/slots syntax of the worker looks very similar to
        standard "single-threaded" signals & slots, note that inter-thread
        signals and slots (automatically) use an event-based QueuedConnection,
        while intra-thread signals use a DirectConnection. See `Signals and
        Slots Across Threads
        <https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/threads-qobject.html#signals-and-slots-across-threads>`_

    Parameters
    ----------
    Worker : QObject
        QObject type that implements a work() method.  The Worker should also
        emit a finished signal when the work is done.
    _start_thread : bool
        If True, thread will be started immediately, otherwise, thread must
        be manually started with thread.start().
    _connect : dict, optional
        Optional dictionary of {signal: function} to connect to the new worker.
        for instance:  connections = {'incremented': myfunc} will result in:
        worker.incremented.connect(myfunc)
    *args
        will be passed to the Worker class on instantiation.
    **kwargs
        will be passed to the Worker class on instantiation.

    Returns
    -------
    worker : WorkerBase
        The created worker.
    thread : QThread
        The thread on which the worker is running.

    Examples
    --------
