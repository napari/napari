    By default, uses :class:`Worker`, but a custom ``WorkerBase`` subclass may
    be provided.  If so, it must be a subclass of :class:`Worker`, which
    defines a standard set of signals and a run method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : Callable
        The function to call in another thread.
    _start_thread : bool, optional
        Whether to immediaetly start the thread.  If False, the returned worker
        must be manually started with ``worker.start()``. by default it will be
        ``False`` if the ``_connect`` argument is ``None``, otherwise ``True``.
    _connect : Dict[str, Union[Callable, Sequence]], optional
        A mapping of ``"signal_name"`` -> ``callable`` or list of ``callable``:
        callback functions to connect to the various signals offered by the
        worker class. by default None
    _progress : Union[bool, Dict[str, Union[int, bool, str]]], optional
        Can be True, to provide indeterminate progress bar, or dictionary.
        If dict, requires mapping of 'total' to number of expected yields.
        If total is not provided, progress bar will be indeterminate. Will connect
        progress bar update to yields and display this progress in the viewer.
        Can also take a mapping of 'desc' to the progress bar description.
        Progress bar will become indeterminate when number of yields exceeds 'total'.
        By default None.
    _worker_class : Type[WorkerBase], optional
        The :class`WorkerBase` to instantiate, by default
        :class:`FunctionWorker` will be used if ``func`` is a regular function,
        and :class:`GeneratorWorker` will be used if it is a generator.
    _ignore_errors : bool, optional
        If ``False`` (the default), errors raised in the other thread will be
        reraised in the main thread (makes debugging significantly easier).
    *args
        will be passed to ``func``
    **kwargs
        will be passed to ``func``

    Returns
    -------
    worker : WorkerBase
        An instantiated worker.  If ``_start_thread`` was ``False``, the worker
        will have a `.start()` method that can be used to start the thread.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If a worker_class is provided that is not a subclass of WorkerBase.
    TypeError
        If _connect is provided and is not a dict of ``{str: callable}``
    TypeError
        If _progress is provided and function is not a generator

    """Decorator that runs a function in a separate thread when called.

    When called, the decorated function returns a :class:`WorkerBase`.  See
    :func:`create_worker` for additional keyword arguments that can be used
    when calling the function.

    The returned worker will have these signals:

        - *started*: emitted when the work is started
        - *finished*: emitted when the work is finished
        - *returned*: emitted with return value
        - *errored*: emitted with error object on Exception

    It will also have a ``worker.start()`` method that can be used to start
    execution of the function in another thread. (useful if you need to connect
    callbacks to signals prior to execution)

    If the decorated function is a generator, the returned worker will also
    provide these signals:

        - *yielded*: emitted with yielded values
        - *paused*: emitted when a running job has successfully paused
        - *resumed*: emitted when a paused job has successfully resumed
        - *aborted*: emitted when a running job is successfully aborted

    And these methods:

        - *quit*: ask the thread to quit
        - *toggle_paused*: toggle the running state of the thread.
        - *send*: send a value into the generator.  (This requires that your
          decorator function uses the ``value = yield`` syntax)

    Parameters
    ----------
    function : callable
        Function to call in another thread.  For communication between threads
        may be a generator function.
    start_thread : bool, optional
        Whether to immediaetly start the thread.  If False, the returned worker
        must be manually started with ``worker.start()``. by default it will be
        ``False`` if the ``_connect`` argument is ``None``, otherwise ``True``.
    connect : Dict[str, Union[Callable, Sequence]], optional
        A mapping of ``"signal_name"`` -> ``callable`` or list of ``callable``:
        callback functions to connect to the various signals offered by the
        worker class. by default None
    progress : Union[bool, Dict[str, Union[int, bool, str]]], optional
        Can be True, to provide indeterminate progress bar, or dictionary.
        If dict, requires mapping of 'total' to number of expected yields.
        If total is not provided, progress bar will be indeterminate. Will connect
        progress bar update to yields and display this progress in the viewer.
        Can also take a mapping of 'desc' to the progress bar description.
        Progress bar will become indeterminate when number of yields exceeds 'total'.
        By default None. Must be used in conjunction with a generator function.
    worker_class : Type[WorkerBase], optional
        The :class`WorkerBase` to instantiate, by default
        :class:`FunctionWorker` will be used if ``func`` is a regular function,
        and :class:`GeneratorWorker` will be used if it is a generator.
    ignore_errors : bool, optional
        If ``False`` (the default), errors raised in the other thread will be
        reraised in the main thread (makes debugging significantly easier).
