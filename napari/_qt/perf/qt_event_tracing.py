    Qt Event handling is nested. A call to notify() can trigger other calls to
    notify() prior to the first one finishing, even several levels deep.

    The hierarchy of timers is displayed correctly in the chrome://tracing GUI.
    Seeing the structure of the event handling hierarchy can be very informative
