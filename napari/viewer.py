        This function finds a tight boundary around the data, resets the view
        around that boundary, takes a screenshot for which each pixel is equal
        to the pixel resolution of the data, then restores the previous zoom
        and canvas sizes.

        The pixel resolution can be upscaled or downscaled by the given
        `scale_factor`. For example, an image with 800 x 600 pixels with
        scale_factor 1 will be saved as 800 x 600, or 1200 x 900 with
        scale_factor 1.5.

        For anisotropic images, the resolution is set by the highest-resolution
        dimension. For an anisotropic 800 x 600 image with scale set to
        [0.25, 0.5], the screenshot will be 800 x 1200, or 1200 x 1800 with a
        scale_factor of 1.5.

        Upscaling will be done using the interpolation mode set on each layer.

        Parameters
        ----------
        path : str, optional
            Filename for saving screenshot image.
        scale_factor : float
            By default, the zoom will export approximately 1 pixel per
            smallest-scale pixel on the viewer. For example, if a layer has
            scale 0.004nm/pixel and another has scale 1Âµm/pixel, the exported
            figure will have 0.004nm/pixel. Upscaling by 2 will produce a
            figure with 0.002nm/pixel through the interpolation mode set on
            each layer.
        flash : bool
            Flag to indicate whether flash animation should be shown after
            the screenshot was captured. By default, True.
