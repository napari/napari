napari plugin architecture
==========================

The napari plugin architecture is contained in an independent package called
`napari-plugin-engine <https://github.com/napari/napari-plugin-engine>`_, which
is a fork of `pluggy <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pluggy>`_.  The concept is
based around:

- **hook specifications**: function signatures that identify an API (argument
  names and types) that plugin developers must adhere to
- **hook implementations**: functions that plugin developers write to extend
  napari functionality, by providing the actual mechanism (implementation) for
  a specific hook specification.

The best place to get started with learning how plugins are incorporated into
napari is to look at the ``napari-plugin-engine`` `documentation
<https://napari-plugin-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.  In particular,
look through the `Usage Overview
<https://napari-plugin-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html>`_ and the
`API Reference
<https://napari-plugin-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html>`_.

The `documentation for pluggy <https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ is
also useful for understanding the concepts, but do note that a lot of the
attribute names and API is different in ``napari-plugin-engine``.
