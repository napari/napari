# Finding and installing a napari plugin

napari plugins are Python packages distributed on the Python Package Index
(PyPI), and annotated with the tag [`Framework ::
napari`](https://pypi.org/search/?q=&o=&c=Framework+%3A%3A+napari).  The
[napari hub](https://napari-hub.org) uses this data, together with additional
metadata, to produce a more user friendly way to find napari plugins.

Similarly, plugins annotated on PyPI with `Framework :: napari` are listed in
the `Plugins > Install/Uninstall Plugins` menu within napari.
