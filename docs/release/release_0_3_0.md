# napari 0.3.0

We're happy to announce the release of napari 0.3.0!

napari is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python.
It's designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional
images. It's built on top of Qt (for the GUI), vispy (for performant
GPU-based rendering), and the scientific Python stack (numpy, scipy).

This is the first "major" release since 0.2.0 and is the culmination of 6
months of work by our developer community. We have made a small number of
breaking changes to the API, and added several new capabilities to napari, so
we encourage you to read on for more details.

## Highlights

### Community and governance

After the 0.2.5 release, which was our first publicly-announced release, we
worked to rapidly turn napari into a mature library in the scientific Python
ecosystem. We added a [code of
conduct](https://napari.org/community/code_of_conduct.html), a [mission
and values
document](https://napari.org/docs/community/mission_and_values.html), and
adopted a [community governance
model](https://napari.org/docs/community/governance.html) (based on
scikit-image's, and since adopted with modifications by zarr). These are
accessible from our [developer resources
page](https://napari.org/developers/index.html), together with a [public
roadmap](https://napari.org/roadmaps/0_3.html) explaining where
the core team will devote effort in the coming months.

We are still humbled by the enthusiasm of the community response to napari and
we hope that the above documents will continue to encourage potential users to
join our community. We welcome contributions of all kinds and encourage you to
get in touch with us if you don't see your most wanted feature in our roadmap,
or as an issue in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/napari/napari/issues).

### Getting in touch

We joined the [image.sc forum](https://forum.image.sc) and actively monitor it
([under the "napari" tag](https://forum.image.sc/tags/napari)) to help users
with any issues they might have using napari and have discussions about
exciting ways to use napari. If you're new to napari and getting started this
is the first place you should go for help.

If you've found a napari bug or have a specific feature request, please let us
know in our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/napari/napari/issues).

### IO plugins

Contributors can now easily extend napari to open and save in a variety of file
formats, both local and remote, through our plugin architecture. The same file
formats as before are available to read (TIFF, most image file formats
supported by imageio, and zarr).  However, we can now *write* to all these
formats, and read and write point and shape annotations in .csv format.
Additionally, we have made it possible for anyone to create packages for napari
to read and write in any other formats through plugins. You can read about our
plugin architecture [here](https://napari.org/plugins/stable/index.html).

Want to drag and drop your favorite file format into napari and have it load
automatically? See [this
guide](https://napari.org/plugins/stable/for_plugin_developers.html) to
understand how to write your own plugin, see Jackson Brown's
[napari-aicsimageio](https://github.com/AllenCellModeling/napari-aicsimageio)
for an exemplar plugin, and get started with Talley's [cookiecutter napari
plugin](https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin)!

Many thanks to Talley Lambert for driving this effort!

### Dockable widgets and magicgui

Another brainchild of Talley is our dockable widget architecture, which allows
you to pop out the napari UI elements from the main window, enabling, for
example, those on multi-monitor setups to have the toolbars on one monitor and
the main window in full-screen on another.

Even better, we have released a side package called
[magicgui](https://github.com/napari/magicgui) to allow you to create your own
dockable widgets with which to interact with napari without writing GUI code.
We are still working on standard models of interaction here (see our
[roadmap](https://napari.org/docs/developers/ROADMAP_0_3.html)), but you should
be able to get started creating useful user interfaces right now. [This
image.sc
post](https://forum.image.sc/t/integration-of-napari-module-subclass-plugin/36018/2)
by Talley provides a good overview of how to create interaction with napari
right now, and [this GitHub
answer](https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/1165#issuecomment-618013894)
explains how to embed a matplotlib plot within napari.

### Multiscale image handling

napari is now much better at handling large datasets. Viewing a large dataset
will no longer trigger automatic — but very slow, and often unnecessary —
generation of an image pyramid. Instead, we direct users to our [tutorial on
how to generate your own
pyramid](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/transform/plot_pyramid.html)
from `scikit-image`. For large arrays, users may want to look at the
[`dask.array.coarsen`
documentation](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/array-api.html#dask.array.coarsen)

If you submit an image pyramid, napari will automatically detect it as such. To
turn off automatic detection, you can now pass the `multiscale=True/False`
parameter to `add_image`. This replaces the `is_pyramid` parameter which has
now been removed. In the future, we aim to add multiscale capabilities to all
our layers.

We have also fixed the bug where too small a tile was shown to fill the entire
canvas.

### Points with properties

Points are no longer generic coordinates floating in space! Each point can have
its own personality and character :-). Specifically, each point can have an
arbitrary number of properties, and attributes such as size, face color, and
edge color can be determined by those properties. This makes it easier to
annotate multiple types of points in an image, such as different cell types. To
assign properties to points you can pass a dictionary as the `properties`
parameter to `add_points`.

### API changes and improvements

We are taking the opportunity of this major release to update a few APIs. We
hope that the number of users impacted by these changes will be small. In each
case, we provide an equivalent API for the same functionality.

- `viewer.add_path` has been renamed `viewer.open` and gained the ability to
  read to any layer type.
- `add_image(path=...)` and `add_labels(path=...)` have been removed. Users
  should use `viewer.open(...)` instead with the `layer_type` parameter to
  force the added data to be a particular layer type, e.g.
  `layer_type='image'` or `layer_type='labels'`.
- Image pyramids are no longer automatically generated when a dataset is large.
  This should not affect API compatibility but might affect performance. For
  most users, this should result in faster startup for large images.
- `add_image(..., is_pyramid=False)` is now `add_image(..., multiscale=False)`.
  This will allow us to use a consistent keyword argument when we add
  multiscale support for other layer types.
- `layer.to_svg()` has been removed. This functionality is now implemented with
  `viewer.save('path/to/layer.svg', layer, plugin='svg')` through our plugin
  architecture.

### And one more thing...

Thanks to the ever-creative Kira Evans, napari will now populate layer names
based on the name of the variables being visualized:

```python
import napari
from skimage import data

camera = data.camera()
with napari.gui_qt():
    viewer = napari.view_image(camera)
    print(viewer.layers[0].name)  # prints "camera"!
```

In Python 3.8, the name will even be visible if you are using the assignment
expression a.k.a. the walrus operator:

```python
import napari
from skimage import data

with napari.gui_qt():
    viewer = napari.view_image(camera := data.camera())
    print(viewer.layers[0].name)  # prints "camera"!
```
