# Profiling

In contrast to performance tracing, profiling does not provide information
about the timing of events, but instead provides combined information about the
total time of execution of each function. It also produces a call graph that
simplifies understanding the call relationship between functions.

The basic tool for profile in Python is the built-in module `cProfile`.
To profile an entire script, use the call:

```bash
python -m cProfile path_to_script.py
```

The output will be a table similar to this one:

```
         2334264 function calls (2267576 primitive calls) in 2.242 seconds

```
The format of this table is documented in the Python docs
[here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html#instant-user-s-manual).
Because the output for complex programs such as napari can be very long,
we suggest piping output to `less`, or saving it to a file,
which can be investigated later. To save the output to file use the `-o` option:

```bash
python -m cProfile -o result.pstat path_to_script.py
```

Once the file is saved, you can investigate using free tools. Some options include:

1.  The Stat object.
    
    You can parse the profile output using the `Stats` object from the `pstats` built-in library. For example:
    ```python
    from pstats import Stats
    stat = Stats("path/to/result.pstat")
    stat.sort_stats("tottime").print_stats(10)
    ```
    You can find more documentation about the Stats object in the Python documentation [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html#the-stats-class).

2.  Snakeviz.
    
    Snakeviz is a third party library designed to visualize profiling output interactively.
    You can install it with pip like any other Python library using `pip install snakeviz`.
    This will provide the `snakeviz` command, which you can call to create an in-browser
    visualization of your profiling data. Use the command:
    ```bash
    snakeviz path/to/result.pstat   
    ```
    This should cause a new page to open in your browser with your profiling information.
    You can read more about how to interpret this visualization on the
    [snakeviz homepage](https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/).

3.  gprof2dot

    You can visualize the call graph with [`graphviz`](https://graphviz.org/),
    a third party graph visualization library.
    You can install graphviz with system package managers:
    
    * Ubuntu: `sudo apt install graphviz`
    * MacOS with brew: `brew install graphviz`
    * Windows with choco `choco install graphviz`

    You can then use `gprof2dot`, a Python library, to convert the `.pstat`
    statistics to a `.dot` graph file and use graphviz:

    ```bash
    $ python -m gprof2dot -f pstats  -n 5  result.pstat -o result.dot
    $ dot -Tpng -o result.png result.dot
    ```
    
    If your shell supports piping, this can all be combined into one command:
    
    ```bash
    $ python -m gprof2dot -f pstats  -n 5  result.pstat -o | dot -Tpng -o result.png
    ```

4.  Some IDEs have built in profiling visualization tools. For example, PyCharm Professional, which is free for academics and open source maintainers, allows viewing `.pstat` files using Tools > Open CProfile snapshot.

cProfile also allows profiling only specific parts of the code.
You can restrict profiling to particular code sections using
`cProfile.Profile()` as a context manager:

```python
import cProfile

with cProfile.Profile() as pr:
    code_for_profile()
pr.dump_stats("result.pstat")
```

The resulting profile can then be visualized using the above methods.

In some situations, you might want to profile code that needs
some preliminary steps to be performed in the viewer, which you
don't want to measure. In this situation, you can create a
button to trigger profiling:

```python
def testing_fun():
    with cProfile.Profile() as pr:
        code_for_profile()
    pr.dump_stats("camera_layers.pstat")

testing_btn = QPushButton("Profile")
testing_btn.clicked.connect(testing_fun)
viewer.window.add_dock_widget(testing_btn)
```

In addition to cProfile, third-party profilers are available in Python:

*  `yappi` with support for multithreading
*  `vmprof` 

Both can be installed with `pip`.
