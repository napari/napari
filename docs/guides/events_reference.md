# Events reference

The following tables contain events that you may connect to.  
For example, to have a specific function called whenever the users
changes the number of dimensions displayed in the viewer (e.g.
from 2D to 3D), you can use `<event>.connect(your_callback)`:

```python
from napari.utils.events import Event
from napari import Viewer

def my_callback(event: Event):
    print("The number of dims shown is now:", event.value)

viewer = Viewer()
viewer.dims.events.ndim.connect(my_callback)
```

## Viewer events
