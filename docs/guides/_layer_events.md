Applied as an extra transform on top of the provided scale, rotate, and shear values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                    |

Options include:  * ``translucent``: voxel colors are blended along the view ray until     the result is opaque. * ``mip``: maximum intensity projection. Cast a ray and display the     maximum value that was encountered. * ``minip``: minimum intensity projection. Cast a ray and display the     minimum value that was encountered. * ``attenuated_mip``: attenuated maximum intensity projection. Cast a     ray and attenuate values based on integral of encountered values,     display the maximum value that was encountered after attenuation.     This will make nearer objects appear more prominent. * ``additive``: voxel colors are added along the view ray until     the result is saturated. * ``iso``: isosurface. Cast a ray until a certain threshold is     encountered.

|  `layer.events.mode`                             |  Interactive mode. The normal, default mode is PAN_ZOOM, which allows for normal interactivity with the canvas.  In PICK mode the cursor functions like a color picker, setting the clicked on label to be the current label. If the background is picked it will select the background label `0`.  In PAINT mode the cursor functions like a paint brush changing any pixels it brushes over to the current label. If the background label `0` is selected than any pixels will be changed to background and this tool functions like an eraser. The size and shape of the cursor can be adjusted in the properties widget.  In FILL mode the cursor functions like a fill bucket replacing pixels of the label clicked on with the current label. It can either replace all pixels of that label or just those that are contiguous with the clicked on pixel. If the background label `0` is selected than any pixels will be changed to background and this tool functions like an eraser.  In ERASE mode the cursor functions similarly to PAINT mode, but to paint with background label, which effectively removes the label.                                                                    |                    |
