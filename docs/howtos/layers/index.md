[Layers](napari.layers) are the viewable objects that can be added to a viewer.
To learn about how to use the layers currently supported by napari, check the
following how-to guides:

These guides assume you have already installed **napari**, know how to launch
the viewer, and are familiar with its layout. For help with installation see our
[installation tutorial](../../tutorials/fundamentals/installation). For help
getting started with the viewer see our
[Getting started guide](../../tutorials/fundamentals/getting_started). For
help understanding the organisation of the viewer, including things like the
layers list, the layer properties widgets, the layer control panels, and the
dimension sliders see our [napari viewer](../../tutorials/fundamentals/viewer)
tutorial. For a high-level overview of the napari Layers, see
[Layers at a glance](../../guides/layers).
