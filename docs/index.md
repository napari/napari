**napari** is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python.
It's designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional
images. It's built on top of `Qt` (for the GUI), `vispy` (for performant
GPU-based rendering), and the scientific Python stack (`numpy`, `scipy`). It
includes critical viewer features out-of-the-box, such as support for large
multi-dimensional data, and layering and annotation. By integrating closely with
the Python ecosystem, **napari** can be easily coupled to leading machine
learning and image analysis tools (e.g. `scikit-image`, `scikit-learn`,
`TensorFlow`, `PyTorch`), enabling more user-friendly automated analysis.

We're developing **napari** in the open! But the project is in an **alpha**
stage, and there will still likely be **breaking changes** with each release.
You can follow progress
[on our GitHub repository](https://github.com/napari/napari), test out new
versions as we release them, and contribute ideas and code.

## Installation

### Which distribution to install

If you want to contribute back to the napari codebase, you should install from
source code: see the [from source](#from-source) section.

If you only wish to use napari as GUI app (and not from python code), the
[bundled app](./tutorials/fundamentals/installation#installing-as-a-bundled-app)
is the easiest way to install, it does not require having python pre-installed.

If you are using napari from Python to programmatically interact with the app,
you can install via pip, conda-forge, or from source.

### From pip, with "batteries included"

napari can be installed on most macOS, Linux, and Windows systems with Python
3.8-3.10 using pip:

```sh
pip install "napari[all]"
```

_(See `Specifying a GUI Backend` below for an explanation of the `[all]` notation.)_

````{important}
While not strictly required, it is *highly* recommended to install
napari into a clean virtual environment using an environment manager like
[conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or
[venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).  For example, with `conda`:

```sh
conda create -y -n napari-env -c conda-forge python=3.9
conda activate napari-env
pip install "napari[all]"
```
````

### From conda

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge napari
```

### Current development branch from github

To install the current `main` branch on github (which will usually be ahead
of the latest release on pypi)

```sh
pip install "git+https://github.com/napari/napari.git#egg=napari[all]"
```

For more information or troubleshooting see our [installation
tutorial](./tutorials/fundamentals/installation)

````{admonition} Specifying a GUI Backend
:class: tip

napari needs a library called [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) to run its user interface
(UI). In Python, there are two alternative libraries to run this, called
[PyQt5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5) and
[PySide2](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/). By default, we don't choose for you,
and simply running `pip install napari` will not install either. You *might*
already have one of them installed in your environment, thanks to other
scientific packages such as Spyder or matplotlib. If neither is available,
running napari will result in an error message asking you to install one of
them.

Running `pip install "napari[all]"` will install the default framework – currently
PyQt5, but this could change in the future.

To install napari with a specific framework, you can use:

```sh
pip install "napari[pyqt5]"    # for PyQt5

# OR
pip install "napari[pyside2]"  # for PySide2
```
````

## Getting started

 If you are new to napari, check out our
 [getting started guide](tutorials/fundamentals/getting_started.md).

### Example

(The example below requires the `scikit-image` package to run. We just use data
samples from this package for demonstration purposes. If you change the example
to use your own dataset, you may not need to install this package.)

From inside an IPython shell or jupyter notebook you can open up an interactive
viewer by calling:

```python
from skimage import data
import napari

viewer = napari.view_image(data.astronaut(), rgb=True)
```

![image](./images/screenshot-add-image.png)

To do the same thing inside a script call (note the call to {func}`napari.run` at
the end)

```python
from skimage import data
import napari

viewer = napari.view_image(data.astronaut(), rgb=True)
napari.run()  # start the event loop and show viewer
```

## Features

Check out the scripts in our `examples` folder to see some of the functionality
we're developing!

**napari** supports six main different layer types, `Image`, `Labels`, `Points`,
`Vectors`, `Shapes`, and `Surface`, each corresponding to a different data type,
visualization, and interactivity. You can add multiple layers of different types
into the viewer and then start working with them, adjusting their properties.

All our layer types support n-dimensional data and the viewer provides the
ability to quickly browse and visualize either 2D or 3D slices of the data.

**napari** also supports bidirectional communication between the viewer and the
Python kernel, which is especially useful when launching from jupyter notebooks
or when using our built-in console. Using the console allows you to
interactively load and save data from the viewer and control all the features of
the viewer programmatically.

You can extend **napari** using custom shortcuts, key bindings, and mouse
functions.

## Tutorials

These are still a work in progress, but we'll be updating them regularly.
