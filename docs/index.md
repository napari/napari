  metaDescription: napari is a fast multi-dimensional image viewer for Python. It can help you **explore** any image-like data, be it 2D, 3D, or even higher-dimensional. It can also help you **overlay** downstream or **associated data**, such as point coordinates or segmentations, which you can use to **annotate** and **proofread** your image data.

Napari is a Python library for n-dimensional image visualisation, annotation,
and analysis. With napari you can:
- **view and explore** 2D, 3D, and higher-dimensional arrays on a canvas;
- **overlay** derived data such as *points*, *polygons*, *segmentations*, and
  more;
- **annotate** and **edit** derived datasets, using standard data structures
  such as NumPy or Zarr arrays, allowing you to
- **seamlessly weave** exploration, computation, and annotation together in
  imaging data analysis.
