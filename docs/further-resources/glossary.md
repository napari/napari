| canvas             | The canvas in the center of napari viewer contains the visual display of the data passed to napari, including images, points, shapes, and other supported data types.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                             |
| channel            | A channel is an image where each pixel only contains its intensity value (i.e. grayscale image). In fluorescence microscopy, each channel corresponds to a range of wavelengths. An RGB image from digital camera consists of 3 channels - red, green, blue (RGB). In napari, an image dimension that is not spatial or temporal can be considered as channels, and is typically represented as individual [image layer](https://napari.org/tutorials/fundamentals/image.html). See also [this wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_(digital_image)) for specific examples.       | raster band in geoscience                                                   |
| colormap           | A colormap represents the value of each pixel as a particular color. In fluorescence microscopy, the colormap can be selected to mirror the color of the collected wavelength. In other applications, colormaps can be used to provide the visual representation of the measured signal. There are many different types of colormaps available, see [choosing colormaps in matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | look up table, LUT                                                          |

| plugin             | A napari plugin is a specialized Python package that extends napari's functionality. Examples of extended functionality include: additional file i/o support, image analysis, and other utilities. Plugin developers specify this functionality through a combination of Python entry points and a specialized manifest file. Plugins for napari can be found at [napari hub](https://www.napari-hub.org/). For a guide on how to make your own custom plugin, see [creating a napari plugin](https://napari.org/plugins/index.html).                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                             |
