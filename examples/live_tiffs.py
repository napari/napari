    Notes
    -----
    Currently, there is no proper way to know if the file has written 
    entirely. So the workaround is we assume that files are generating 
    serially (in most microscopes it common), and files are name in 
    alphanumeric sequence We start loading the total number of minus the 
    last file (`total__files - last`). In other words, once we see the new 
    file in the directory, it means the file before it has completed so load
    that file. For this example, we also assume that the microscope is 
    generating a `final.log` file at the end of the acquisition, this file 
    is an indicator to stop monitoring the directory.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str
    directory to monitor and load tiffs as they start appearing.
