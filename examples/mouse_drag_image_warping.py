"""
Image warping with mouse event callbacks
========================================

Warp an image based on points moved by user using mouse event callbacks in
napari.

Derived from scikit-image example: https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/transform/plot_tps_deformation.html

This example is fully explained in the following tutorial from SciPy 2025:
https://napari.org/napari-scipy2025-workshop/notebooks/image_warping.html

Credit to Lars GrÃ¼ter for the original idea and first attempts at implementation at SciPy 2024.
