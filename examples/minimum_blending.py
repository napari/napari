"""
Minimum blending
================

Demonstrates how to use the `minimum` blending mode with inverted colormaps.
`minimum` blending uses the minimum value of each R, G, B channel for each pixel.
`minimum` blending can be used to yield multichannel color images on a white 
background, when the channels have inverted colormaps assigned.
An inverted colormap is one where white [1, 1, 1] is used to represent the lowest 
values, as opposed to the more conventional black [0, 0, 0]. For example, try the
colormaps prefixed with *I*, such as *I Forest* or *I Bordeaux*, from
