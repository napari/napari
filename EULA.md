    that Your use of the Materials or distribution of the Redistributables with
    Your Product as permitted by this Agreement may require You to procure
    license(s) from third parties that may hold intellectual property rights
    applicable to any media decoding, encoding or transcoding technology (e.g.,
    the use of an audio or video codec) and/or digital rights management
    capabilities of the Materials, if any. Should any such additional licenses
    be required, You are solely responsible for obtaining any such licenses and

        b. Additional Rights and Restrictions for Features made Available with the Software.
            i. Windows App Requirements. If you intend to make your program available in the Windows Store, the program must comply with the Certification
Requirements as defined and described in the App Developer Agreement, currently available at:
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh694058.aspx.
            ii. Bing Maps. The software may include features that retrieve content such as maps, images and other data through the Bing Maps (or successor
branded) application programming interface (the “Bing Maps API”) to create reports displaying data on top of maps, aerial and hybrid imagery. If these
features are included, you may use these features to create and view dynamic or static documents only in conjunction with and through methods and means of
access integrated in the software. You may not otherwise copy, store, archive, or create a database of the entity information including business names,
addresses and geocodes available through the Bing Maps API. You may not use the Bing Maps API to provide sensor based guidance/routing, nor use any Road
Traffic Data or Bird’s Eye Imager (or associated metadata) even if available through the Bing Maps API for any purpose. Your use of the Bing Maps API and

            iv. Push Notifications. The Microsoft Push Notification Service may not be used to send notifications that are mission critical or otherwise could
affect matters of life or death, including without limitation critical notifications related to a medical device or condition. MICROSOFT EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS
ANY WARRANTIES THAT THE USE OF THE MICROSOFT PUSH NOTIFICATION SERVICE OR DELIVERY OF MICROSOFT PUSH NOTIFICATION SERVICE NOTIFICATIONS WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED,
ERROR FREE, OR OTHERWISE GUARANTEED TO OCCUR ON A REAL-TIME BASIS.
            v. Speech namespace API. Using speech recognition functionality via the Speech namespace APIs in a program requires the support of a speech
recognition service. The service may require network connectivity at the time of recognition (e.g., when using a predefined grammar). In addition, the service
may also collect speech-related data in order to provide and improve the service. The speech-related data may include, for example, information related to
grammar size and string phrases in a grammar.
            vi.     Also, in order for a user to use speech recognition on the phone they must first accept certain terms of use. The terms of use notify the
user that data related to their use of the speech recognition service will be collected and used to provide and improve the service. If a user does not accept
the terms of use and speech recognition is attempted by the application, the operation will not work and an error will be returned to the application.
            vii. PlayReady Support. The software may include the Windows Emulator, which contains Microsoft’s PlayReady content access technology.  Content
owners use Microsoft PlayReady content access technology to protect their intellectual property, including copyrighted content.  This software uses PlayReady
technology to access PlayReady-protected content and/or WMDRM-protected content.  Microsoft may decide to revoke the software’s ability to consume
PlayReady-protected content for reasons including but not limited to (i) if a breach or potential breach of PlayReady technology occurs, (ii) proactive
robustness enhancement, and (iii) if Content owners require the revocation because the software fails to properly enforce restrictions on content usage.
Revocation should not affect unprotected content or content protected by other content access technologies.  Content owners may require you to upgrade
PlayReady to access their content.  If you decline an upgrade, you will not be able to access content that requires the upgrade and may not be able to install
other operating system updates or upgrades.
            viii. Package Managers. The software may include package managers, like NuGet, that give you the option to download other Microsoft and third
party software packages to use with your application. Those packages are under their own licenses, and not this agreement. Microsoft does not distribute,
license or provide any warranties for any of the third party packages.
            ix. Font Components. While the software is running, you may use its fonts to display and print content. You may only embed fonts in content as
permitted by the embedding restrictions in the fonts; and temporarily download them to a printer or other output device to help print content.
            x. Notice about the H.264/AVD Visual Standard, and the VC-1 Video Standard. This software may include H.264/MPEG-4 AVC and/or VD-1 decoding
technology. MPEG LA, L.L.C. requires this notice:
        c. THIS PRODUCT IS LICENSED UNDER THE AVC AND THE VC-1 PATENT PORTFOLIO LICENSES FOR THE PERSONAL AND NON-COMMERCIAL USE OF A CONSUMER TO (i) ENCODE

INFORMATION MAY BE OBTAINED FROM MPEG LA, L.L.C. SEE WWW.MPEGLA.COM.
        d. For clarification purposes, this notice does not limit or inhibit the use of the software for normal business uses that are personal to that
business which do not include (i) redistribution of the software to third parties, or (ii) creation of content with the VIDEO STANDARDS compliant technologies
for distribution to third parties.
        e. INTERNET-BASED SERVICES. Microsoft provides Internet-based services with the software. It may change or cancel them at any time.
        f. Consent for Internet-Based Services. The software features described below and in the privacy statement at
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839 connect to Microsoft or service provider computer systems over the Internet. In some cases, you will not receive
a separate notice when they connect. In some cases, you may switch off these features or not use them as described in the applicable product documentation. By
using these features, you consent to the transmission of this information. Microsoft does not use the information to identify or contact you.
            i. Computer Information. The following features use Internet protocols, which send to the appropriate systems computer information, such as your
Internet protocol address, the type of operating system, browser, and name and version of the software you are using, and the language code of the device
where you installed the software. Microsoft uses this information to make the Internet-based services available to you.
                • Software Use and Performance.  This software collects info about your hardware and how you use the software and automatically sends error
reports to Microsoft.  These reports include information about problems that occur in the software.  Reports might unintentionally contain personal
information. For example, a report that contains a snapshot of computer memory might include your name. Part of a document you were working on could be
included as well, but this information in reports or any info collected about hardware or your software use will not be used to identify or contact you.
                • Digital Certificates. The software uses digital certificates. These digital certificates confirm the identity of Internet users sending
X.509 standard encryption information. They also can be used to digitally sign files and macros to verify the integrity and origin of the file contents. The
software retrieves certificates and updates certificate revocation lists using the Internet, when available.
                • Windows Application Certification Kit. To ensure you have the latest certification tests, when launched this software periodically checks a
Windows Application Certification Kit file on download.microsft.com to see if an update is available.  If an update is found, you are prompted and provided a
link to a web site where you can download the update. You may use the Windows Application Certification Kit solely to test your programs before you submit
them for a potential Microsoft Windows Certification and for inclusion on the Microsoft Windows Store. The results you receive are for informational purposes
only. Microsoft has no obligation to either (i) provide you with a Windows Certification for your programs and/or ii) include your program in the Microsoft
Windows Store.
                • Microsoft Digital Rights Management for Silverlight.
                • If you use Silverlight to access content that has been protected with Microsoft Digital Rights Management (DRM), in order to let you play
the content, the software may automatically
                • request media usage rights from a rights server on the Internet and
                • download and install available DRM Updates.
                • For more information about this feature, including instructions for turning the Automatic Updates off, go to
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=147032.
                1. Web Content Features.  Features in the software can retrieve related content from Microsoft and provide it to you. To provide the content,
these features send to Microsoft the type of operating system, name and version of the software you are using, type of browser and language code of the device
where you installed the software. Examples of these features are clip art, templates, online training, online assistance, help and Appshelp. You may choose
not to use these web content features.
            ii. Use of Information. We may use  nformation collected about software use and performance to provide and improve Microsoft software and services
as further described in Microsoft’s Privacy Statement available at: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=521839. We may also share it with others, such as
hardware and software vendors. They may use the information to improve how their products run with Microsoft software.
            iii. Misuse of Internet-based Services. You may not use these services in any way that could harm them or impair anyone else’s use of them. You
may not use the services to try to gain unauthorized access to any service, data, account or network by any means.
    3. YOUR COMPLIANCE WITH PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION LAWS.
        a. Personal Information Definition. "Personal Information" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an
identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an

    8. SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is “as is,” we may not provide support services for it.
    9. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire
agreement for the software and support services.
    10. INDEPENDENT PARTIES.  Microsoft and you are independent contractors. Nothing in this agreement shall be construed as creating an employer-employee
relationship, processor-subprocessor relationship, a partnership, or a joint venture between the parties.
    11. APPLICABLE LAW AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. If you acquired the software in the United States or Canada, the laws of the state or province where you
live (or, if a business, where your principal place of business is located) govern the interpretation of this agreement, claims for its breach, and all other
claims (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort claims), regardless of conflict of laws principles. If you acquired the software in any
other country, its laws apply. If U.S. federal jurisdiction exists, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal court in King
County, Washington for all disputes heard in court. If not, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior Court of King
County, Washington for all disputes heard in court.
    12. LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your country. You may also have rights with
respect to the party from whom you acquired the software. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of your
country do not permit it to do so.
    13. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. The software is licensed “as-is.” You bear the risk of using it. Microsoft gives no express warranties, guarantees or
conditions. You may have additional consumer rights or statutory guarantees under your local laws which this agreement cannot change. To the extent permitted
under your local laws, Microsoft excludes the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.
FOR AUSTRALIA – You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in these terms is intended to affect those rights.
    14. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. You can recover from Microsoft and its suppliers only direct damages up to U.S. $5.00. You cannot
recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits, special, indirect or incidental damages.
This limitation applies to

    agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your
    state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you
    acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory
    country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:

    -   AUSTRALIA. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian
        Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect

        how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.

    -   GERMANY AND AUSTRIA.

        (i) WARRANTY. The properly licensed software will perform
        substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that

        guarantee in relation to the licensed software.

        (ii) LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. In case of intentional conduct,
        gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as
        well as, in case of death or personal or physical injury,
        Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.

    -   Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only be
        liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such
        material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which
        facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of
        which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the
        compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called
        "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence,
        Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.

-   DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS.” YOU BEAR
    THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES,

    third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract,
    breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability,
    negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.

    It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about
